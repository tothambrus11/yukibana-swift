# Stage 05 — apply Yukibana's patch series to the checked-out sources.
#
# Two repositories need patches, for two different reasons:
#
#   llvm/  — POSIX facilities LLVM assumes that wasm32-wasip1 simply lacks: processes,
#            signals, sockets, resource limits, setjmp. All guarded on __wasi__ so a
#            native build of the same tree is unaffected.
#   swift/ — build-system assumptions that break when the host stdlib comes prebuilt
#            from an SDK rather than being built in-tree.
#
# They are deliberately small, so they stay upstreamable.
# Idempotent: patches already applied are skipped.
